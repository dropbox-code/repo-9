# Immutable Seaport-Core

A fork of OpenSea/seaport-core to enable the Immutable seaport fork.

## Upstream Management
`main` always tracks the upstream directly. Released Seaport versions are tagged and diffs to enable the Immutable fork are applied on top of these tags from base branches (i.e `1.5.0-base`)
